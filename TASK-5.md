In this repo I have solved the Task 5 from the room https://tryhackme.com/r/room/adventofcyber24sidequest

So lets start and see what they have to offer us on the day 5 of the AOC quest, its a XXE room and by using that room we can check the content of the apache server,

So in order to retrieve we have two methods
1. By requesting to localhost:8080
2. By manual enumeration

to be done later...
